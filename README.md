# CanCanTogether
 CMP105 and CMP303 combined project, Multiplayer game about legs kicking things, made from scratch using sfml library

Charachter is procedurally animated using a heirarchy of bounding boxes
These boxes are used in OBB collision detection system which then triggers a physics response in the objects

The game is networked with hosting player having the authority over the simulation. Networking is also done using SFML library.
